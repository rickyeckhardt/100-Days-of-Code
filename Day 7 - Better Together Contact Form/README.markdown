# Better Together Form - Day 7 - 100 DAYS - 2020 
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/abOLrBx](https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/abOLrBx).

 Tonight's pen is based on a layout that I stumbled upon by Brass Hands. 

They have some pretty solid design work. I didn't go responsive on this, but I did keep the look and feel similar. 

I went full black and only change font size, weight, and face. I also choose to go a little more colourful. My animations are tame because I don't feel you need to jazz everything to death. It's a form after all! 

Overall I think the week was a success! I had fun building all the forms and I learned one or two things. I also discovered more fantastic designers and developers. 

Tomorrow starts the next sprint. I am leaning animation, but a week of generative art of art, in general, would be fun.
