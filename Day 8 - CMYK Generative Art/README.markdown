# CMYK Generative Art - Day 8 - 100 DAYS - 2020
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/poJdyVZ](https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/poJdyVZ).

 Today's pen was based on an exhibit at the Chrysler Museum of Art. 

This is also my first piece made for the Codepen generative art challenge. It's neat thinking everyone gets a different piece. 

I've done other art before, but generative art can get crazy. Some of my pieces are in the 10s of thousands of lines. With the 1MB limit we'll see how far we can take that! 

This week I am going to focus on art pieces in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll probably stay on the modern side, but we'll see.
