 Day five down! 

I started this pen off fairly early in the day but I didn't get to finish all of the functionality I wanted for it. 

I would have liked to add the other cards to it! Maybe tomorrow I'll just finish this! Really love the colours! 

So far I think the 100 days of code is helping me learn, think, and grow. It'll be fun to move on to the next topic in a few days. 

Well, back to the C++ grind!
