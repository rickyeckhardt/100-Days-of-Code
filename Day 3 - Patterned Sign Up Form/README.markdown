 It was a busy weekend! 

For day three I had higher hopes, but homework got in the way! Patterns looked fun, so I just went with it.  It's mono-colour but I think it works to drive the user still to click. It's an interesting UI/UX adventure tonight. I love the colours. 

I would like to do a little more, but I need to schedule my day and/or plan more. It's hard so far every day to sit down and code. I want each daily piece to really be something unique and explore an interesting idea or piece to push my skills in the area. 

Pen down! Better luck tomorrow!
