 Today I built out a wedding invite as a form.

I'm going to be honest and say the Sass is a little sloppy! I got thru the day and got something built, so I'm happy. I'll come back refactor and clean it up sometime in the next day. 

I think it's a fun little exploration into a digital wedding invite. 

I could not find really any examples or inspiration on Dribbble this time around! 

Well on to day 7 and then something new!
