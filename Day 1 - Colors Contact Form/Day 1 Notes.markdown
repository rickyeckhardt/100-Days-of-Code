 I wanted to play with color today and a form. This is a pretty fun result after about an hour and a half this morning. I was at work WAY too early and just dove into this quick sketch to warm up. 

This semester I am taken a class that helps flesh out our careers as software engineers. One of the tasks is to do something daily to help build yourself. I've been posting on Codepen for years, but I have yet to complete a straight 100 days of code challenge. 

So for the next 100 days my tasks to myself is to pen something everyday, push it to my GitHub, and help build out my social media presence to just put myself out there. 

It's going to be crazy, but lets try. If I miss a day I won't beat myself up, but I want to see how close I can get over 100 days of competing my goal. With a new born, a toddler, and school it might be insane to even try!
